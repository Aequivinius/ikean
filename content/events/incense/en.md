The tea ceremony speaks to all five senses ⸺ the taste of smell is particularly focused by the use of special incense, which purifies the room and the mind. Autumn is the best time to smell the incense, for the air is clear and bright.

So in this presentation, not only will I give a brief introduction into the Japanese tea ceremony in general, but also focus on the incense. What types of incense are used, and how do they work?

This presentation takes place at [hōmu in Basel](https://homu.ch/). Presentations take place at 13:30 and 15:30, and are held in German. Reservations can be made [here](welcome@homu.ch).
