This is a set consisting of a tea caddy, a tube for the tea whisk and a dispenser for small sweets, all used for the 茶箱. All items are fashioned in 春慶塗, allowing you to see the wood grain.

The tea caddy has a special shape: To the initiated, it looks like the indentation of the head of the mythical creature called 河童 or 河太郎. The 河童 in Japanese folklore has an indentation in its head, often filled with water, symbolizing its connection to rivers and ponds where it resides. This water is the source of its strength, and if the liquid is spilled, the 河童 becomes powerless. This is quite useful, because these creatures can be quite aggressive. Should you encounter one, just remember to bow, forcing the Japanese creature to bow itself and spill the water.

Sold as a set, each item with a paper box.
