Never before have I had a tea scoop that scoops so well. I named it 見解, which is the reply Zen disciples try to give in response to their kōan. While the superficial meaning of the response is not so important, its delivery and the clarity of it are. So when scooping the tea with this scoop, I think one can glimpse at this feeling.

Comes in a paper box. The 棗 on the photo is for comparison only: In this photo, I used a 小棗.

*[見解]: kenge
