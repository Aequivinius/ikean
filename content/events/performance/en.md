With its choreographed movements, the Japanese tea ceremony can often seem a bit rigid. But what happens when both guest and host fully immerse themselves in the prescribed dialogues and sequences? Does it then truly become a complete work of art where the line between observer and performer blurs? And how is this orchestrated within the tearoom?<br/>This presentation aims to decode what a guest contributes to a successful tea invitation. While based on the perspective of the tea ceremony, the insights seamlessly transition into the art of being a good guest in everyday life.

This presentation takes place at [h≈çmu](https://homu.ch/) in Basel. Presentations take place at 13:00 and 15:00.
