The tea ceremony could better be named an *invitation with tea*. In a true ceremony, guests are treated to an artful four-hour experience: food, *sake*, incense, and of course, tea. This presentation explores what makes a good host within the concept of a *tea invitation*, a perspective that's easy to understand in the West, where (formal) invitations hold significant value. Yet, it remains fascinating, as the Japanese tea ceremony arrives at very different answers.

This presentation lasts about 60 minutes; and will feature an extensive explanation of the topic of the day, a traditional Japanese sweet as well as a presentation of the formal presentation of *matcha*. The audience will sit on chairs (and will not have to sit on their shins like in a traditional setting).

This presentation takes place at [h≈çmu](https://homu.ch/) in Basel. Presentations take place at 13:00 in German and at 15:00 in English.
