The path through the garden (路地, *roji*), the stone basin for washing hands, the *tatami* mats, the alcove for the hanging scroll — all of these are elements of tea architecture. They are not chosen at random; rather, they are carefully designed and coordinated to support the flow of the tea ceremony. Yet the most important space is not visible: the tea ceremony also creates a *spiritual space* — a place where everyday concerns can be set aside and genuine human encounter becomes possible.
