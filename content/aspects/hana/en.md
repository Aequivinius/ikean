Flowers for tea are quite different from the more famous 生花. Tea master 利休 is said to have used simple a freshly cut bamboo as a flower vase, and arrange a few simple flowers in while trying to avoid ostentation. As [in cooking](#kaiseki), the flower is not as much a decoration as it is a way to communicate hospitality, the ephemeral and the transmission of the Buddhist teachings.


*[生花]: ikebana, Japanese flower arrangement.
*[利休]: Rikyū
