        <p><p>The meal that precedes the serving of the tea has become an art in itself: To prepare a good bowl of tea, one needs good fire; and a good fire needs time. To fill this time, the <abbr title="kaiseki">懐石</abbr> meal has developed and has in itself become a formidable vessel for hospitality.</p>
<p>For my practice, I thus stick to <abbr title="Takeno Jōō">武野紹鴎</abbr>'s principle of <abbr title="ichijū sansai">一汁三菜</abbr>, which means one soup, three sides (something vinegared, something in a shallow dish and something broiled). With these dishes, the host can utilise seasonal ingredients and thus give an <em>actual</em> taste of the season, rather than only <em>referring</em> to it with the <a href="toys.html">utensils</a> used for the tea.</p>
<p>Speaking of utensils, the full tea invitation has two parts: In the first part, <abbr title="kaiseki">懐石</abbr> is served in the presence of a Zen hanging scroll; it is replaced by a <a href="#flowers">flower</a> when the tea is served in the second part. I like to see this as a juxtaposition of <em>modes of transmission</em>: At first, the transmission of seasonality is through taste, so more emotional, and the transmission of Zen transience by the scroll, so more cerebral; while in the second part of the invitation, these modes are inversed: The flower communicates the Zen teaching on an emotional level just like with <abbr title="Mahākāśyapa, a Zen monk who was enlightened by seeing the Buddha holding up a single flower">大迦葉</abbr>; and the utensils offer a more intellectual approach to the seasonality or theme of the invitation.</p></p>

        <p><p>The Japanese tea ceremony is a bit notorious for setting rules for everything: What paper the invitation needs to be written on, what ceramics to use on specific days, and which directions to turn the tea bowl ⸺ only to name a few. To the uninitiated, this may seem excessive, but for me, they help my hospitality in several ways.</p>
<p>Firstly, they establish a <strong>language of hospitality</strong>. We know we want to show our guests our consideration and respect; but <em>how</em> do we actually do this? What are actions that we can take to <em>communicate</em> our feelings effectively; especially knowing that words are not often the best medium for such matters? So by turning the tea bowl so it faces them when we serve it, we are saying: <em>Here I present to you the very best part of what I can offer you, because I respect you</em>.</p>
<p>Secondly, it broadens our horizon,  our vocabulary, if you so will, of what we can do to express our feelings. With time, a certain <em>idiomaticity</em> of what actions and tools best express a sentiment has become established. So when we deliberately use a piece of <abbr title="Oribe-yaki, a style of ceramics">織部焼</abbr> when we open the hearth, we are following ways that have been established by generations of tea practitioners.</p>
<p>Thirdly, these rules can also free mental capacity and create room for creativity. By knowing what paper is used for the invitations traditionally, we can focus on other things that may have a bigger impact for our guests; and by breaking some of these rules show our understanding of hospitality.</p></p>

        <p><p>On one of her last seminars, I got a chance to ask <abbr title="Michiko Nojiri">野尻命子</abbr> about the tea utensils. Through her friendship with <abbr title="Raku Kichizaemon, XVI">樂吉左衞門</abbr> she had the chance to see many a valuable tea bowl, and yet she explained that without a tea bowl, you can't have tea. So if you have a tea bowl for 100 円, you are grateful, because without it, you wouldn't be able to drink tea. In this spirit, all the utensils are necessary and important, regardless of their pedigree.</p></p>

        <p><p>While tea need not be a religious practice, it has been closely related to Zen buddhism since its conception. That being said, it has also been a playground for establishing social hierarchies, for artistic expression and economic endeavors. So it is not intrinsically a Zen practice, but can be made into one just as well as any mundane task can be.</p></p>

        <p><p>It is called the <em>tea</em> ceremony, but tea is just a vessel for hospitality. In a bowl, you can make out three different tastes: the water, the actual tea and the host's heart. But then again, try drinking three bowls of tea on empty stomach: Tea is not always the best answer. Thus I strive to bring the same care the tea ceremony fosters to everything I serve, be it tea, whisky or a plain glass of water.</p>
<p>In saying that, in Japanese tea training, the taste of the tea is often only an afterthought. However, the taste is a powerful channel of communication; and even if the aromatic range of Japanese powdered green tea is limited, it does warrant attention.</p>
<p>Cheap matcha, especially, can be bitter and harsh; and especially for the uninitiated taste unpleasant. At the same time, I feel that higher quality teas can lack the bitterness that contrasts the sweets. In fact, I think a little bitterness is necessary, as it expressed well the melancholy aesthetic of the Japanese tea ritual: we first eat the sweets, and then we drink a mildly bitter tea. We enjoy the aftertaste of sweetness through the veil of bitterness; just as the memory of a warm summer day in cold winter touches us much more than that sunny day itself.</p>
<p>My school uses the teas of <abbr title="Koyamaen">小山園</abbr>, and while I'm not shying away from others, I like most their <abbr title="wakou">和光</abbr>, which I usually use for its full, but not cloying umami taste. See my <a href="https://tea.hedonisms.ch/wiki/matcha">tasting notes</a> of other teas.</p></p>

        <p><p>Flowers for tea are quite different from the more famous <abbr title="ikebana, Japanese flower arrangement.">生花</abbr>. Tea master <abbr title="Rikyū">利休</abbr> is said to have used simple a freshly cut bamboo as a flower vase, and arrange a few simple flowers in while trying to avoid ostentation. As <a href="#kaiseki">in cooking</a>, the flower is not as much a decoration as it is a way to communicate hospitality, the ephemeral and the transmission of the Buddhist teachings.</p></p>

        <p><p>The tea ritual serves to establish a <em>sacred </em><em>space</em><em><em> that elevates the mundane task of making a simple cup of tea into a higher realm. So in a way, with its prescribed movements, intention and care, we are already creating a </em>space</em>.</p>
<p>However, it is also well-known that only very advanced practitioners manage to hold a tea gathering outside and prevent the minds of the guests from swaying. So a prepared tea <em>space</em> helps the guests to stay focused and enjoy the hospitality we're trying to offer them. From this idea, a whole architectural style of the <em>thatched hut tea room</em> has evolved, and even been expanded to include a garden in front of the tea room which the guests will walk through on their way.</p></p>

        <p><p>While many today, even in Japan, don't wear <abbr title="kimono">着物</abbr> for a tea invitation, it is important to remember that textiles are the quintessential symbol for culture. When we are naked, usually, we are private; and are part of society only as clothed individuals. Because of this, is it not astonishing that many patterns used in tea ceremony textiles have been used continuously for over 1000 years.</p></p>

        <p><p>As described under <a href="#tea">tea</a>, the sweets and tea form an inseparable unit. Even if you omit the charcoal, the <a href="#kaiseki">meal</a> and all decorum, you wouldn't fail to serve sweets to your guests. Traditionally, <abbr title="nerikiri">練切</abbr> are served. These sweets are made of a coloured bean paste and shaped into seasonally appropriate shapes. They can be very expressive, but since they are usually made from the same materials, do not convey a <em>taste</em> of the season.</p>
<p>However, it is important that the taste of the sweets does not overpower the taste of the tea. In this regard, Japanese tea sweets are particular in their avoidance of fats, which will linger in the mouth and hinder the appreciation of the tea. This needs to be kept in mind when trying out non-Japanese sweets.</p></p>

        <p><p>When the guests arrive to a tea ceremony today, they are usually served <abbr title="kōsen">香煎</abbr>, water that is flavoured by something else than tea. However, purists would argue that it is better to serve the water that will be later used to make the tea plain, so that the guests can taste it. The word <abbr title="kōsen">香煎</abbr>, which includes the character <abbr title="kō, incense">香</abbr>, is used because this plain water is served while the incense is wafting from the tea room.</p>
<p>Independently of whether you opt to serve plain or flavoured water, this demonstrates one of the functions of incense in the tea room: a subtle means to create expectation.</p></p>

        <p><p>The <em>Japanese</em> tea ceremony is steeped in <em>Japanese</em> culture, and many utensils and patterns make reference to distinctly Japanese stories and symbols. At the same time, respect and hospitality are universal, and not limited to Japanese culture. As a non-Japanese practitioner of the tea ceremony, it is interesting to try and find analogies for the Japanese symbols in our own culture; and to incorporate Japanese symbols in my own culture.</p>
<p>Of course, there's the danger of what I like to call <em>Japan-washing</em>, or <em>cultural appropriation</em>, against which the best guard is a good understanding of the culture, a deep respect for it and the lack of trying to make a profit from it.</p>
<p>In saying that, the tea ceremony has since its beginnings been an eclectic endeavour. It originally evolved in Japan as a way to revere Chinese objects; but soon also included Korean bowls like the <abbr title="Kizaemon Ido tea bowl">喜左衛門</abbr>, Christian symbols <abbr title="Takayama &quot;Justo&quot; Ukon, a XVI century Christian tea practitioner">ジュスト高山右近</abbr> used, for example, and Dutch delftware so sought after that even <abbr title="Ogata Kenzan">尾形乾山</abbr> made copies of it.</p></p>
