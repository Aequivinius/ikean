This is a scroll that unfortunately I cannot read, nor have I found someone who can. However, I think the free calligraphy looks a bit like the smoke from an incense stick, and, in fact, it does look quite appetising when displayed with an incense burner in the 床 as you can see on the picture.

Comes in a cardboard tube with the 帛紗 for displaying, but the incense burner and incense tray are not included.
