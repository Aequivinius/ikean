This tube-shaped tea bowl was purchased at the now-closed 萬珠堂 store in Kyōto. Its shape lends itself to be used in winter, and its name 万雷 invites you to enjoy a warm bowl of tea while outside a storm is drawing near.

To support this tempestial theme, I am pairing this bowl with a 帛紗 called 瑞鶴, which is favoured by 鵬雲斎. The silk of this cloth is very stiff; and it comes in a repurposed paper box.

*[万雷]: banrai

*[帛紗]: fukusa

*[瑞鶴]: zuikaku, joyous crane

*[鵬雲斎]: Hōunsai
