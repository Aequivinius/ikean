The meal that precedes the serving of the tea has become an art in itself: To prepare a good bowl of tea, one needs good fire; and a good fire needs time. To fill this time, the 懐石 meal has developed and has in itself become a formidable vessel for hospitality.

For my practice, I thus stick to 武野紹鴎's principle of 一汁三菜, which means one soup, three sides (something vinegared, something in a shallow dish and something broiled). With these dishes, the host can utilise seasonal ingredients and thus give an *actual* taste of the season, rather than only *referring* to it with the [utensils](toys.html) used for the tea.

Speaking of utensils, the full tea invitation has two parts: In the first part, 懐石 is served in the presence of a Zen hanging scroll; it is replaced by a [flower](#flowers) when the tea is served in the second part. I like to see this as a juxtaposition of *modes of transmission*: At first, the transmission of seasonality is through taste, so more emotional, and the transmission of Zen transience by the scroll, so more cerebral; while in the second part of the invitation, these modes are inversed: The flower communicates the Zen teaching on an emotional level just like with 大迦葉; and the utensils offer a more intellectual approach to the seasonality or theme of the invitation.
