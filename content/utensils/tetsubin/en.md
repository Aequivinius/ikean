A small 鉄瓶 that I found on an antique market and used for several years for 茶箱 and 略盆 practise. It served me very well, and the pine cone-lid adds a certain charm. It's practically free from rust, but it built up a substantial chalk crust. While it doesn't affect the taste of the water and actually helps protect the iron from rusting, still some people don't like it ⸺ it can be easily removed with a bit of vinegar. Please indicate in the comment if you wish me to remove it when ordering. Comes with a repurposed paper box.
