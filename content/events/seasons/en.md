While we divide our year into four seasons, cultivated Japanese people recognize 72 distinct micro-seasons. This reflects the sensitivity poets and tea practitioners develop, celebrating even the smallest changes in nature. In the tearoom, this sense of seasonality plays a central role: the arrangement and selection of utensils evolves throughout the year, creating a rhythm that oscillates between anticipation and wistful joy for things like fresh eggplants or the sound of cicadas on a summer evening.<br />Especially today, as we feel the impacts of climate change, the tea ceremony offers a space to reconnect with and deepen our appreciation for the natural world.
