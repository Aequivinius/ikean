The *Japanese* tea ceremony is steeped in *Japanese* culture, and many utensils and patterns make reference to distinctly Japanese stories and symbols. At the same time, respect and hospitality are universal, and not limited to Japanese culture. As a non-Japanese practitioner of the tea ceremony, it is interesting to try and find analogies for the Japanese symbols in our own culture; and to incorporate Japanese symbols in my own culture.

Of course, there's the danger of what I like to call *Japan-washing*, or *cultural appropriation*, against which the best guard is a good understanding of the culture, a deep respect for it and the lack of trying to make a profit from it.

In saying that, the tea ceremony has since its beginnings been an eclectic endeavour. It originally evolved in Japan as a way to revere Chinese objects; but soon also included Korean bowls like the 喜左衛門, Christian symbols ジュスト高山右近 used, for example, and Dutch delftware so sought after that even 尾形乾山 made copies of it.
