The Japanese tea ceremony is a bit notorious for setting rules for everything: What paper the invitation needs to be written on, what ceramics to use on specific days, and which directions to turn the tea bowl ⸺ only to name a few. To the uninitiated, this may seem excessive, but for me, they help my hospitality in several ways.

Firstly, they establish a **language of hospitality**. We know we want to show our guests our consideration and respect; but *how* do we actually do this? What are actions that we can take to *communicate* our feelings effectively; especially knowing that words are not often the best medium for such matters? So by turning the tea bowl so it faces them when we serve it, we are saying: *Here I present to you the very best part of what I can offer you, because I respect you*.

Secondly, it broadens our horizon,  our vocabulary, if you so will, of what we can do to express our feelings. With time, a certain *idiomaticity* of what actions and tools best express a sentiment has become established. So when we deliberately use a piece of 織部焼 when we open the hearth, we are following ways that have been established by generations of tea practitioners.

Thirdly, these rules can also free mental capacity and create room for creativity. By knowing what paper is used for the invitations traditionally, we can focus on other things that may have a bigger impact for our guests; and by breaking some of these rules show our understanding of hospitality.
