This type of 棗 was developed by 玄々斎, and it's quite steeped in meaning. On the top you find his calligraphy saying 「一粒万倍」, which means *a single seed can eventually produce a great harvest*. It is thus quite suitable to use this 棗 during the harvest period during autumn.

However, the meaning goes a bit deeper than just the mere seasonality. The name 「徳風」comes from Confucian teachings: *a small man is like a blade of grass; while a great man is like the virtuous wind that bends it*, implying that it is the purpose of great people to act virtuously and thus shape the little people.

This is a 写 of the original tea caddy. It has a small crack at the bottom; and comes in a cardboard box.
