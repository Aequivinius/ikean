*The tea scoop is the sword of the tea master*, they say, and thus this tea scoop is named after an *actual* sword ⸺ probably *the* sword of Nordic sagas. In Wagner's operas it is called *Nothung*, in Norse mythology *Gram*, and in other versions of the story again *Balmung*. It is the sword the shards of which the hero of the saga inherits; reforges them to a new sword and allows him to slay the dragon. For the tea ceremony, I think the aspect of the *reforging* is particularly interesting; and makes this tea scoop particularly suitable for October.

It was carved by a Japanese businessman who also practised tea ceremony and liked to carve tea scoops from old temple bamboo. It comes with a bamboo tube, which I have added, just as the name, *ex-post*; and a paper box.

To tame the bold name and shape a tad, I'm pairing this with a pink 帛紗 with gingko prints. The cloth comes its own cardboard box.
