<p><abbr title="wabi sabi">侘び寂び</abbr> literally means <em>lonely and quiet</em>. It's a concept that is as popular as it is frequently misunderstood. Still, it has had a profound impact on the Japanese tea ceremony, and so maybe through the tea it can be better understood. </p>
<p>In October, we feel a nostalgia for the passing summer, so this is a good time to deal with this difficult to grasp topic. So in this presentation, not only will I give a brief introduction into the Japanese tea ceremony in general, but also focus on <abbr title="wabi sabi">侘び寂び</abbr>. How does this concept impact the Japanese tea ceremony, and how can it be applied to our everyday lives?</p>
