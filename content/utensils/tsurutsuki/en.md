The artist behind this special tea caddy is the 2<sup>nd</sup> generation 昭阿弥, a family who makes some of the more interesting 清水焼. He studied painting originally at the Kyōto university of arts, which might explain why his style of ceramics are painted richly, evoking a vivid Japanese atmosphere.

The shape of the tea caddy itself is called 弦付, which means *with handle*. There is a set of four special tea caddies called the 四滴, which are traditionally used for thin tea when in the preceding tea service a lacquered tea caddy such as a 棗 was used. However, this particular example, can very well stand on its own and contribute to an atmosphere of freshness.

Because of its split lid, it is also handled in a special manner: While a normal 弦付 is quite easy to handle, here you also need to open half of the lid. The opened half can then either be placed on the opposite site similar to an 老松棗, or be placed on the floor like with a normal 薄茶器.
