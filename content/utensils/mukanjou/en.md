A student asked the monk 洞山良价 how he should deal with the cold and the heat. 洞山 replied: *Just go where it's not cold nor hot*. But in saying this, he did not mean to travel to such a place, but instead to be like the water ladle we use in the tea ceremony. It doesn't feel the heat of the 釜, nor does it shiver when we scoop cold water with it, because it has no mind. I would use this scoop when the seasons are particularly strongly felt.

The maker was a successful bank owner who also was a practitioner in the Japanese tea ceremony. He carved many tea scoops and bamboo utensils, preferably from bamboo he obtained from old temples. Comes with a paper box.
