侘び寂び literally means *lonely and quiet*. It's a concept that is as popular as it is frequently misunderstood. Still, it has had a profound impact on the Japanese tea ceremony, and so maybe through the tea it can be better understood.

In October, we feel a nostalgia for the passing summer, so this is a good time to deal with this difficult to grasp topic. So in this presentation, not only will I give a brief introduction into the Japanese tea ceremony in general, but also focus on 侘び寂び. How does this concept impact the Japanese tea ceremony, and how can it be applied to our everyday lives?

This presentation takes place at [hōmu in Basel](https://homu.ch/). Presentations take place at 13:30 and 15:30, and are held in German. Reservations can be made [here](welcome@homu.ch).

*[侘び寂び]: wabi sabi
