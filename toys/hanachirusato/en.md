This tea scoop is made from sooty bamboo. It shares the name with chapter 11 in the famous Tale of Genji: 花散里, which means *flowers scattered across the village*. In this chapter, Prince Genji spends a rainy summer afternoon speaking about the days of yore and enjoying the scent of the fallen citrus blossoms called 橘.

I think that in this tea scoop you find a similar strength and melancholy. It is particularly suitable for summer; and comes with a paper box and paper *shifuku*. The square paper and *natsume* are just for comparison and not included.

*[橘]: tachibana
*[花散里]: hana chiru sato
