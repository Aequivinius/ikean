In late autumn, days can still be surprisingly warm and mind. Skies are clear because it is dry, temperatures are warm and the leaves of the trees are turning exceptionally red and orange. These *small springtimes* invite you to go out and visit the beautiful sceneries of forests changing their colour; quite similar to the cherry blossom viewings in (actual) spring. Comes with a paper box for the tea scoop.
