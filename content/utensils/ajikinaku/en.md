This 香合 is made in red lacquer carving in the shape of hydrangea (紫陽花 in Japanese.) With its deep, melancholy colour it reminds me of the following poem (which is also written on the lid of the paper box):

「花咲きし庭のあぢさゐあぢきなくなどてよひらに我をすてけん」

*The hydrangeas bloom in the garden, yet I feel so worthless—
Why have you abandoned me so lightly, like a fleeting blossom?*

It was written by 小野小町, a female poet of the IX century.

*[小野小町]: Komachi Ono

*[紫陽花]: ajisai

*[香合]: kougou, incense container
