A soft red 楽-style tea bowl with almost an orange hue, with a small indentation at the bottom of the bowl that makes it particularly suitable for 茶の湯. The artist called it 曙, a name that makes this bowl particularly suitable for the New Year; but also any time a feeling of a 初心 is called for.

The artist was a tea practitioner himself, and passed away in 2020, after having won several [awards](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9B%BD%E9%A0%98%E5%AF%BF%E4%BA%BA).

Comes with the artist's box, the calligraphy on which is written by 表千家 XII

*[曙]: akebono

*[表千家]: Omotesenke

*[初心]: shoshin, fresh heart
