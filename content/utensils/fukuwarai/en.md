This simple 萩焼 tea bowl's soft pink hue reminds me of the 葩餅, which is traditionally eaten in January. I thus named it 福笑, which is also used at the beginning of the New Year.

The bowl broke during transport, so it was repaired by [Ursula Kaspar](https://www.japanraum.net/kintsugi) in Switzerland using traditionally 銀継. It turns out that the name was well-chosen, given that in German we say *Scherben bringen Glück* ⸺ the 福 in 福笑 meaning *good luck*, as well. Comes in a cardboard box.

*[萩焼]: Hagi ware

*[葩餅]: hanabira mochi

*[福笑]: fuku warai

*[銀継]: silver joinery
