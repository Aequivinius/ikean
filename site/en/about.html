    <p>I'm originally a bartender who turned to the Japanese tea ritual in search for a <strong>theory of hospitality</strong>. Since the beginning of my training in 2015, I had the tremendous opportunity to study under various <abbr title="Urasenke, one of the main tea schools">裏千家</abbr> teachers in Japan and Europe. My practice room I initially put together with things from <em>IKEA</em> only, hence I gave it the name <abbr title="ikean, pond hermitage">池庵</abbr>. There, I try to host <abbr title="chaji, tea invitation">茶事</abbr> to deepen my understanding of the way of tea.</p>
<p>While I still haven't found my theory of hospitality, through the tea ceremony I learned two important things: <strong>Humility</strong> and <strong>transience</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Humility</em> in my comportment and as an aesthetic ideal. As a host, I try not to strive not to impress the guest. This is difficult, because at the same time I want to bring out the best tea, show the utmost consideration and use the finest silverware, metaphorically speaking. Yet all these should only serve to make the guest feel comfortable, not to show off my refinement. So, for everything I do and for every thing I use, I ask: does it help the guest to feel at ease, or is it just to impress him? Am I using it for the guest's sake or my own?</p>
<p>Likewise, the tools we use and the architecture that surrounds the encounter should show restraint in their elegance, so that they underline the hospitality and do not distract from it with their beauty. If they draw too much attention, the guest's mind cannot come to rest. Instead, if the guest seeks to be entertained, only then should the refinement become apparent. While many Japanese arts express such an ideal, it is not confined to Japanese culture, and I am trying to find counterparts in European designs.</p>
<p><em>Transience</em> as a guiding motif. Realising that every instant — a bowl of tea, a cocktail or a walk in the sun – is unique, and will never happen again in precisely the same way gives infinite value to it: Rare things are precious, so unique things are invaluable. This realisation is a reminder of the joy of being alive right now, and gives the guest a chance to focus completely on the here and now, temporarily sheltering him from the ghosts of yesterday and the woes of tomorrow. Simultaneously, it serves as a <em>memento mori</em>, and allows lightness of being that our mortality affords us put matters in a good perspective.</p>
<p>However, all of us often fail to see things this way, and the host can help the guest to remember this; thus increasing the guest's enjoyment. In the decoration and matters of taste, the <em>seasons</em> and tasteful <em>signs of wear</em> and use are principal. Again, while many Japanese arts embody these principles, <em>vanitas</em> motifs are not uncommon in European culture, at all.</p>
