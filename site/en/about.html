    <p>I'm originally a bartender who turned to the Japanese tea ritual in search for a <strong>theory of hospitality</strong>. Since the beginning of my training in 2015, I had the tremendous opportunity to study under various <abbr title="Urasenke, one of the main tea schools">裏千家</abbr> teachers in Japan and Europe. My practice room I initially put together with things from <em>IKEA</em> only, hence I gave it the name <abbr title="ikean, pond hermitage">池庵</abbr>. There, I try to host <abbr title="chaji, tea invitation">茶事</abbr> to deepen my understanding of the way of tea.</p>
<p>While I still haven't found my theory of hospitality, through the tea ceremony I learned about two important things: <strong>Humility</strong> and <strong>transience</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Humility</em> in my comportment and as an aesthetic ideal. As a host, I try not to strive not to impress the guest. This is difficult, because at the same time you want the guests feel well taken care of. However, everything I do should only serve to make the guest feel comfortable, not to show off whatever refinement I might have. So, for everything I do and for every thing I use, I try to ask myself: Am I doing this for the guest's sake or my own.</p>
<p>Likewise, the tools we use and the architecture that surrounds the encounter should show restraint in their elegance, so that they underline the hospitality and do not distract from it with their apparent beauty. If they draw too much attention, the guest's mind cannot come to rest. Instead, if the guest seeks to be entertained, only then should the refinement become apparent.</p>
<p><em>Transience</em> means realising that every instant is unique, and will never happen again in precisely the same way.  Rare things are precious, thus such unique instants are invaluable. Give the guest a chance to focus completely on the here and now, temporarily sheltering him from the ghosts of yesterday and the woes of tomorrow. Simultaneously, it serves as a <em>memento mori</em>, and allows the lightness of being that our mortality affords us put matters in a good perspective. In the decoration and matters of taste, the <em>seasons</em> and tasteful <em>signs of wear and use</em> are principal, as they help the guest to remember such transience.</p>
