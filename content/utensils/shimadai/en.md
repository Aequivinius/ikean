This set of tea bowls is traditionally used for 初釜, and is full with auspicious symbols. The foot of the inner bowl is pentagonal, representing the crane; while the one of the outer bowl is hexagonal, representing the turtle. The crane is lined with gold; the turtle with silver. They are very suitable for the preparation of thick tea for a large number of guests; but can also be used individually. Comes with the artist's box.

*[初釜]: hatsugama, first tea invitation of the year
