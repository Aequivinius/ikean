This is a classic example of a 四滴 tea caddy. These tea caddies are made of ceramics and usually have an ivory lid, but still are used for light tea! This happens when the host decided to use a lacquered tea caddy such as a 棗 for the service of thick tea, for example in 茶通箱 or in 包帛紗.

This particular example is a 水滴, and is inspired by the tool that calligraphers use to add *drops of water* to their ink. Comes with a paper box.
