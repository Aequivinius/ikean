This 天目 bowl is probably made by a Chinese or Taiwanese artist, with a very delicate 兎毫盞 glaze. It is easy to lose yourself in that deep glaze, so I called it 魔境; the illusions or distracting thoughts that occur during meditation. Comes with a 仕覆 and a cardboard box.

*[天目]: tenmoku

*[兎毫盞]: hare's fur
