In late autumn, days can still be surprisingly warm and mind. Skies are clear because it is dry, temperatures are warm and the leaves of the trees are turning exceptionally red and orange. These *small springs* invite you to go out and visit the beautiful sceneries of forests changing their colour; quite similar to the cherry blossom viewings in (actual) spring.

This tea scoop I thus paired with 相良間道, named after a clan of the same name and evokative of the autumn scenery changing its colours with its bright orange and green colours. It has never been used before, so it remained un-folded for the photo. Comes with a paper box for the tea scoop.
