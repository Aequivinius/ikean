Traditionally, 早乙女 refers to the women who plant rice in the paddy fields during the early summer, a time crucial for the rice-growing cycle in Japan. The act of planting rice is not only vital for agriculture but is also steeped in cultural rituals and festivals that celebrate and honor the agricultural heritage of Japan.
