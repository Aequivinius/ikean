This style of tea bowl is traditionally used on New Year's Eve, but it could also be used for birthdays or other moments that mark the turning of time. The reason for this is its 歴手 pattern, with the 12 lunar months of the year.

It is made by a prolific 清水焼 [artist](https://kyoyaki.com/kamamoto/kippogama/) in Kyōto, and comes with a wooden and an outer paper box.

*[歴手]: koyomite, an ancient calendar

*[清水焼]: kiyomizu yaki
