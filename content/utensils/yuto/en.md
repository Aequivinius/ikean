This vessel is a **湯桶 (yutō)**, a simple lidded container with a handle and spout, usually lacquered, that plays an important role in *kaiseki* cuisine.

At the end of the meal, the host demonstrates that all of the rice has been eaten. The slightly scorched rice left at the bottom of the pot is loosened with hot water, creating a light broth known as **湯漬け (yuzuke)** or **湯炊き (yudaki)**. This is poured from the *yutō* and served with the remaining grains of rice.

This final, very plain dish carries several meanings:

- it **completes** the meal,
- it shows **respect for every single grain of rice**,
- and it expresses the **aesthetic of simplicity** in *kaiseki*, a reminder of gratitude for the most basic nourishment.

The guests use this broth to drink, but also to rinse the bowls they have used during the kaiseki meal to pay their respect to the host. The *yutō* itself is usually made of lacquered compressed wood.
