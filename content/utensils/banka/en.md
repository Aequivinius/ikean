This is a tea scoop with the node at the end, so it is used canonically only for certain higher preparations. The name thus is suitable: During the evening chanting of sutras, the monks purify themselves of the metaphysical dust they've accumulated during the day; just like the tea scoop is purified of the metaphysical dust that is the tea.

It is paired with an unusual cloth: A fabric napkin from the 60s, produced by Zurich company Mavir for Swissair first class flights. It is slightly smaller than a normal 古帛紗, and is delivered with a repurposed 古帛紗-cardboard box.
