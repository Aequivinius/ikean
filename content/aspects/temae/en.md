The Japanese tea ceremony doesn't start when the guest enters the room, but when the host sends an invitation on paper (after the the date and all have already been settled upon).

This is not just a mere formality, but an essential part of the congregation: It sets the expectation, which in turn acts as a basis for the gathering. The guest knows what they can expect, and thus can gauge the level of formality (and appropriate reimbursement). The host knows about the guests' expectation, and thus can play with it.

There is the story of Hideyoshi, who wanted to see RikyÅ«'s morning glories in the tea garden; but when he arrived, they all had been cut. Instead, when he entered the room, he found a single morning glory in the alcove. Such a surprise only was possible in the light of his expectation.

This is not contrained to the tea ceremony, though, but is relevant in today's gastronomy as well. Asking a guest *what brings you here?* doesn't need to be an empty formality, but helps to establish what expectations they hold.
