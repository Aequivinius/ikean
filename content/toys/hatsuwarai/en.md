January is a month of *firsts*: 初夢, 初釜 and 書初 are quite famous, but there are many other, quite important things, such as 初笑, the first laughter of the year.



*[初夢]: はつゆめ, the first dream of the new year

*[初釜]: はつがま, the first tea invitation of the new year

*[書初]: かきぞめ, first calligraphy of the new year
