# To Do
- [ ] run the `pytest`s

## Toys
- [ ] integrate the `for_sale` to schema
- [ ] buy button (maybe with formspree)?
- [ ] gallery should begin at [1] for non-modelled items. Not sure how to do this elegantly.
- [ ] add the actual items
- [x] desktop page: Item photo should be on the left, its description on the right
- [ ] categories could be systematised
- [ ] Seasonality
- [ ] structured information (especially in Japanese, right now, we still have *made by* in there)

## Home
- [ ] home page should link to contact
- [ ] Replace Times with Garamond or Noto Serif; also have fonts locally for offline development
- [ ] `<a>`s need styling
- [ ] Japanese needs its own style sheet, the item description looks shit in italics

## Content
- [ ] aspects
- [ ] presentations

## Deployment
- [ ] domain
- [ ] deploy

## Nice to have
- [ ] better language switcher for japanese
- [ ] small footer
- [ ] set up CI/CD
- [ ] add filter for toys
