This green powder which we use to make a bowl of tea has become mainstream: You'll find it now in pastries, in milk beverages and at grocery stores. But what's special about 抹茶?

In this presentation, not only will I give a brief introduction into the Japanese tea ceremony in general, but also focus on the actual tea. What are the qualities you are looking for in great 抹茶? How is it made, how does it differ from other teas, and what's the best way to prepare it?

This presentation takes place at [hōmu in Basel](https://homu.ch/). Presentations take place at 13:30 and 15:30, and are held in German. Reservations can be made [here](welcome@homu.ch).

*[抹茶]: matcha
