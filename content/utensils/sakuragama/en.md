This tea bowl I like particularly for the glaze: parts of the bowl are covered in what looks like oil drops, or to the more poetic mind, like cherry blossom petals, or 夜桜, in the night sky. It is contemporary 薩摩焼, but made closer to the old style, which uses a dark clay and a dark glaze.

*[夜桜]: yozakura

*[薩摩焼]: satsuma ware
