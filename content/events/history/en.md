The procedures of the tea ceremony (点前, *temae*) are precisely defined — and that's exactly what makes them liberating. At the same time, they connect us to a long line of past tea masters whose insights have enriched the practice. This presentation highlights how influential figures such as the Zen monk Rikyū, the feudal lord Matsudaira, and the industrialist Masuda have shaped and developed the tea tradition across centuries. The tea ceremony is not a finished project — it is a mirror of its time and a window into the past.
