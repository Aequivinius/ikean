Unlike the orthodox cylindrical bamboo *futaoki*, craftsmen often create seasonal or playful designs, especially for summer, when fresh water and aquatic motifs feel especially refreshing. This is a lid rest used in summer in the shape of a crab (カニ, *kani*), made from cast iron.

It evokes riversides and the seaside, places associated with coolness in the summer heat. As a lid rest, the crab form adds a touch of humor and charm, while still fulfilling its practical function of supporting the bamboo ladle (*hishaku*) and kettle lid.

The design here is naturalistic, with careful attention to the legs and claws, and the shell bears a decorative pattern.
