In the Japanese tea ceremony, the tea bowl is not only used for drinking, but also ritually admired by the guests. This is called 拝見 (*haiken*), and almost every object — tea scoop, water container, and more — is given this kind of attention. What makes a good tea bowl? And how does the host decide which utensils form a harmonious ensemble? In this sense, the tearoom becomes a kind of museum — one where you are allowed (and even encouraged) to touch and use everything! It opens up a unique perspective on art, craft, and appreciation — one that extends beyond the tearoom and enriches our everyday lives.
