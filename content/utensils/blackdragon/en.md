There is a cultivar of the wisteria plant called *black dragon* that can produce flowers so dark purple they appear black to the poetically inclined. I thought this was a suitable name for this 小棗 and the corresponding 香合, a matching set for the 茶箱.

Sold as a set, comes in a paper box.

*[小棗]: ko natsume, small tea caddy

*[香合]: kougou, incense container

*[茶箱]: chabako
