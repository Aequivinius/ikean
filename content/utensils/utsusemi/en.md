The name is a pun in several ways: First of all, in itself, the *shell of the locust* is quite a poetic symbol. We need to leave our former selves behind to grow. But it is also the name of a character in the Tale of Genji; a lady that is not necessarily beautiful, but impressed Prince Genji with her stout behaviour and good taste. In my opinion, this aspect suits the simple, yet elegant make of this tea scoop.

Lastly, however, the word 空蝉 itself is interesting. It usually means *a living being* in general, instead of the locust shell. This is because the characters used to write this word were added ex-post for their sounds rather than their meaning; and with time, the word also got the meaning of *hollow locust*.

With circadas being a strong summer motif, this tea scoop might be most suitable in summer; but with the more philosophical interpretation of its name, it also lends itself to all-year use for thick tea. It comes with a paper box and bamboo tube. The bamboo tube was added later on, and is not made by the original maker of the scoop.

The maker was a successful bank owner who also was a practitioner in the Japanese tea ceremony. He carved many tea scoops and bamboo utensils, preferably from bamboo he obtained from old temples.

*[空蝉]: utsusemi
