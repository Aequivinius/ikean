t is called the tea ceremony, but tea is just a vessel for hospitality. In a bowl, you can make out three different tastes: the water, the actual tea and the host's heart. But try drinking three bowls of tea on empty stomach: Tea is not always the best answer. Thus I strive to bring the same care the tea ceremony fosters to everything I serve, be it tea, whisky or a plain glass of water.
In saying that, in Japanese tea training, the taste of the tea is often only an afterthought. However, the taste is a powerful channel of communication; and even if the aromatic range of Japanese powdered green tea is limited, it does warrant attention.
Cheap matcha, especially, can be bitter and harsh; and especially for the uninitiated taste unpleasant. At the same time, I feel that higher quality teas can lack the bitterness that contrasts the wagashi sweetness. In fact, I think a little bitterness is necessary, as it expressed well the melancholy aesthetic of the Japanese tea ritual: we first eat the sweets, and then we drink a mildly bitter tea. We enjoy the aftertaste of sweetness through the veil of bitterness; just as the memory of a warm summer day in cold winter touches us much more than that sunny day itself.
My school uses the teas of Koyamaen, and while I'm not shying away from others, I like most their wako, which I usually use for its full, but not cloying umami taste. See my tasting notes of other teas.
