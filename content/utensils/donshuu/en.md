This scroll has a Confucian flavour: It reads 「吞舟之魚不游枝流」, which means *fish that can swallow a whole boat do not swim in shallow waters*. It is usually followed by saying 「鴻鵠高飛　不集污池」(*giant birds fly high and don't sit in swamps*). Implied is that if you have high aspirations, you need to follow your dreams and be careful about what environments you are in; but also to not be held up with trivial matters.

Comes with the 帛紗 for displaying, and a cardboard tube.

*[吞舟之魚不游枝流]: donshuu no uo wa shiryuu ni oyogazu
