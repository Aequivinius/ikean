There is a somewhat mysterious course in the 懐石 menu: The 箸洗, which literally means *chopstick washing*. It is a very light soup with some solids, the primary purpose of which is really to rinse the chopsticks. However, it also serves a secondary purpose: after this course, 八寸 follows; and here the host will use the lids of these 箸洗 cups to serve little delicacies.

These cups have a pine needle motif, so I think it is quite suitable to serve in them a light soup with some roasted pine nuts. Set of 5, only used twice; comes in a paper box.

*[懐石]: kaiseki
