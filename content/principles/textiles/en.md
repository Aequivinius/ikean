While many today, even in Japan, don't wear 着物 for a tea invitation, it is important to remember that textiles are the quintessential symbol for culture. When we are naked, usually, we are private; and are part of society only as clothed individuals. Because of this, is it not astonishing that many patterns used in tea ceremony textiles have been used continuously for over 1000 years.
