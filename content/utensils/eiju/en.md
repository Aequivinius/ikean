This tea scoop is made from an old material; and I bought it at the 竹子堂 antique store in Tōkyō in 2016. It has a natural discoloration, and could be used for more intricate tea procedures such as 台天目. While such spoons usually don't carry a name, its clear, long lines prompted me to call it 永寿. Comes with a paper box.
