This 赤楽 tea bowl got a bit damaged in transport, including a little hole! I had it fixed by Swiss 金継ぎ artist [Ursula Kaspar](https://www.japanraum.net/kintsugi), and have named it 開運. This means to be open for good fortune to come in, which I found fitting, given the hole it had that now, fixed in silver, adds interest and depth.

*[赤楽]: aka raku, red raku
