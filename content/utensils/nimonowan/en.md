The main course in the 懐石 meal is something simmered and served in a light, clear broth. It is usually something seasonal, delicately arranged; like a steamed fish dumpling or some seasonal vegetables; and invariably served in a bowl. The course hence is also called 椀盛, with 碗 meaning bowl.

These bowls are lacquered in the 柿合せ style, which allows the wood grain to be seen. This is a set of five bowls with matching lids, which I bought in 2018 on [rikyucha](https://www.rikyucha.com/item/list2/283041), and have used it twice since. It is made from lacquered, compressed wood powder (so what appears to be wood grain here is probably not real).
