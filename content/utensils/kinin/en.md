Traditionally, a 貴人 is served from a new, white 天目-shaped bowl. This bowl, however, is slightly bent outwards, which gives it a more inviting shape. While it may seem odd to practise a procedure for a nobleman in today's society; I think it is a very smart element of the tea curriculum: First you learn how to treat a nobleman with additional respect than others; then you treat everyone with *that* level of respect.

The bowl comes with a 仕覆 with a 段唐草割付紋, so it can also be used for 茶箱, or even for practising higher 点前 (even though a proper 天目 bowl and lacquered stand would be used for those).

The bowl and stand both come in a paper box.
