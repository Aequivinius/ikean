The 琵琶 is a Japanese instrument similar to a lute, and is often associated with melancholy. To use an instrument is a particularly suitable shape for an incense container, as the Japanese use the word 聞く, literally *to listen*, for the appreciation of incense.

It is made by an artist from a [family](http://shunteian.com/) who have received numerous awards and held exhibitions all over the world. Comes in the artist's box, with an inscription.

The inscription (花押) is by 田中仙翁, the son of the founder of the 大日本茶道学会, an organisation that promotes an open discussion and research on the way of tea beyond secret transmissions and different styles.
