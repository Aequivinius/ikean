The meal that precedes the serving of the tea has become an art in itself: To prepare a good bowl of tea, one needs good fire; and a good fire needs time. To fill this time, the 懐石 meal has developed.

For my practise, I thus stick to Jōō's principle of 一汁三菜, which means one soup, three sides (something vinegared, something in a shallow dish and something broiled).

*[一汁三菜]: ichijū sansai
*[懐石]: kaiseki
