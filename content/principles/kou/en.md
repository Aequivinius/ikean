When the guests arrive to a tea ceremony today, they are usually served 香煎, water that is flavoured by something else than tea. However, purists would argue that it is better to serve the water that will be later used to make the tea plain, so that the guests can taste it. The word 香煎, which includes the character 香, is used because this plain water is served while the incense is wafting from the tea room.

Independently of whether you opt to serve plain or flavoured water, this demonstrates one of the functions of incense in the tea room: a subtle means to create expectation.

*[香煎]: kōsen
*[香]: kō, incense
