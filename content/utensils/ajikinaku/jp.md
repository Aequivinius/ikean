<p>This <abbr title="香合, 香合, incense container">香合</abbr> is made in red lacquer carving in the shape of hydrangea (<abbr title="紫陽花">紫陽花</abbr> in Japanese.) With its deep, melancholy colour it reminds me of the following poem (which is also written on the lid of the paper box):</p>
<p>「花咲きし庭のあぢさゐあぢきなくなどてよひらに我をすてけん」</p>
<p><em>The hydrangeas bloom in the garden, yet I feel so worthless—
Why have you abandoned me so lightly, like a fleeting blossom?</em></p>
<p>It was written by <abbr title="小野小町">小野小町</abbr>, a female poet of the IX century.</p>
