These spoons are used to shape the ash in the 風炉. The resulting shape is called 灰型, and is one of the few things the host actually does themselves in terms of 道具. So some people attribute much value to a good 灰型, going as far as to say that the ash form they see at the beginning of a tea invitation tells them already how the rest is going to follow. While I wouldn't go that far myself, I find it very meditative; and would recommend all practitioners practise a little bit. [These videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZaaDkW7pk) I found very useful when starting out.

It is a set of 3 spoons: The one the left is great for working around the 五徳, the one in the middle for flattening the ash and the one on the right for cutting the ridges when doing the most classical shape, the 二文字. Comes in a paper box.
