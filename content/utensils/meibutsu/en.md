In the tea tradition, *meibutsu* (“celebrated objects”) are famous utensils, often named, treasured, and passed down through the hands of great tea masters and daimyō. Among them, *chaire* (ceramic tea caddies for thick tea, *koicha*) occupy a special place. Each *meibutsu* has a unique shape, glaze, provenance, and story.

Since the originals are priceless and held in museums or temple treasuries, potters and tea practitioners often produced **utsushi (写, copies)** of these famous pieces. Such *utsushi* allow students of tea to study and experience the form, proportions, and atmosphere of a *meibutsu*. Far from being “fakes,” these copies are a respected tradition that keeps the forms alive.

It is hard to stress how important tea caddies were in ancient Japan. Important warlords used these little objects imported from China to show their wealth and aesthetic sense. This is such a copy (*utsushi*, 写) of the famous 岩城文琳茶入 (*Iwaki Bunrin Chaire*), which belonged to the Iwaki clan. The shape is called *bunrin*, which literally means *apple shape* (for obvious reasons).

The pouch (*shifuku*) is in **Rikyūbai (利休梅) kinran**, a gold brocade pattern of plum blossoms associated with the famous monk Sen no Rikyū. He is said to have favored this fabric.
