This is a tea bowl from the late German ceramicist [Beatrix Sturm-Kerstan](https://sturm-kerstan-keramik.de/), who passed away in 2023. She had made tea bowls specifically for tea for almost 20 years from German clay. Its colour makes me think of the bottom of the ocean, where nothing moves and all is quiet; and so I gave it the name 静寂. It comes in a repurposed paper box.

I'm pairing it with a presentation 帛紗 with a crest to commemorate this great artist. The silk comes with its own paper box.

*[静寂]: sei jaku
