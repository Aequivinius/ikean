A rustic *chaire* (tea caddy) in brown ceramic with natural glaze variations and kiln marks, complete with ivory-colored *shifuku* (silk pouch) in a wheel and floral pattern, and original protective paper box. The ivory lid is finely turned with concentric rings. The body shows rich patina and firing spots, giving it a strong wabi-sabi character. A fine piece for storing *koicha* in the tea ceremony.
