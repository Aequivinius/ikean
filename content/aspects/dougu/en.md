On one of her last seminars, I got a chance to ask 野尻命子 about the tea utensils. Through her friendship with 樂吉左衞門 she had the chance to see many a valuable tea bowl, and yet she explained that without a tea bowl, you can't have tea. So if you have a tea bowl for 100 円, you are grateful, because without it, you wouldn't be able to drink tea. In this spirit, all the utensils are necessary and important, regardless of their pedigree.
