This 萩焼-style 井戸-bowl has little specks of pink, like little specks of sun through the greenery. It gives me a feeling of heralding spring, so I gave it the name 流氷. Imagine blocks of ice flowing down a mountain river!

However, with so many seasonal words, it also serves as a reminder to take care of our environment, lest names like this become only a reminder of the past.

Note that this bowl has a small fissure at the rim. Comes in a cardboard box.
