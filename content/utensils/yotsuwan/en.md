A *yotsuwan* (四椀) is a set of four lacquer bowls of graduated size that stack together. They are traditionally used in **Zen temple meals** (*shōjin ryōri*), each bowl serving a specific element of the meal such as rice, soup, or side dishes. In the context of **kaiseki** cuisine (the meal accompanying the tea ceremony), *yotsuwan* represent the most orthodox and austere form of serving ware, rooted in monastic life. A typical serving would be: Rice in the largest bowl, and miso soup in the third largest bowl. The other bowls act as lids, but can also be stacked when they are not used during the dining.

The simplicity of plain black lacquer highlights the food itself and embodies the spirit of **wabi** and monastic restraint.

This is complete set of **five yotsuwan**, each consisting of four nested bowls (20 bowls in total) made from lacquered compressed wood powder.
