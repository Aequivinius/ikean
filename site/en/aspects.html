        <p><p>The meal that precedes the serving of the tea has become an art in itself: To prepare a good bowl of tea, one needs good fire; and a good fire needs time. To fill this time, the <abbr title="kaiseki">懐石</abbr> meal has developed.</p>
<p>For my practise, I thus stick to Jōō's principle of <abbr title="ichijū sansai">一汁三菜</abbr>, which means one soup, three sides (something vinegared, something in a shallow dish and something broiled).</p></p>

        <p><p>The Japanese tea ceremony doesn't start when the guest enters the room, but when the host sends an invitation on paper (after the the date and all have already been settled upon).</p>
<p>This is not just a mere formality, but an essential part of the congregation: It sets the expectation, which in turn acts as a basis for the gathering. The guest knows what they can expect, and thus can gauge the level of formality (and appropriate reimbursement). The host knows about the guests' expectation, and thus can play with it.</p>
<p>There is the story of Hideyoshi, who wanted to see Rikyū's morning glories in the tea garden; but when he arrived, they all had been cut. Instead, when he entered the room, he found a single morning glory in the alcove. Such a surprise only was possible in the light of his expectation.</p>
<p>This is not contrained to the tea ceremony, though, but is relevant in today's gastronomy as well. Asking a guest <em>what brings you here?</em> doesn't need to be an empty formality, but helps to establish what expectations they hold.</p></p>

        <p><p>It is called the <em>tea</em> ceremony, but tea is just a vessel for hospitality. In a bowl, you can make out three different tastes: the water, the actual tea and the host's heart. But try drinking three bowls of tea on empty stomach: Tea is not always the best answer. Thus I strive to bring the same care the tea ceremony fosters to everything I serve, be it tea, whisky or a plain glass of water.</p>
<p>In saying that, in Japanese tea training, the taste of the tea is often only an afterthought. However, the taste is a powerful channel of communication; and even if the aromatic range of Japanese powdered green tea is limited, it does warrant attention.</p>
<p>Cheap matcha, especially, can be bitter and harsh; and especially for the uninitiated taste unpleasant. At the same time, I feel that higher quality teas can lack the bitterness that contrasts the wagashi sweetness. In fact, I think a little bitterness is necessary, as it expressed well the melancholy aesthetic of the Japanese tea ritual: we first eat the sweets, and then we drink a mildly bitter tea. We enjoy the aftertaste of sweetness through the veil of bitterness; just as the memory of a warm summer day in cold winter touches us much more than that sunny day itself.</p>
<p>My school uses the teas of <em>Koyamaen</em>, and while I'm not shying away from others, I like most their <strong>wako</strong>, which I usually use for its full, but not cloying umami taste. See my <a href="https://tea.hedonisms.ch/wiki/matcha">tasting notes</a> of other teas.</p></p>
