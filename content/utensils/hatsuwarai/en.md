January is a month of *firsts*: 初夢, 初釜 and 書初 are quite famous, but there are many other, quite important things, such as 初笑, the first laughter of the year. It is thus a good tea scoop for January, and lends lightness to the otherwise more austere mood of thick tea.

Comes with a paper box.



*[初夢]: hatsuyume, the first dream of the new year

*[初釜]: hatsugama, the first tea invitation of the new year

*[書初]: kakizome, first calligraphy of the new year
