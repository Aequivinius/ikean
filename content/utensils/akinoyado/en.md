This 香合 is a 見立て piece, that is, an item that is taken from outside the world of 茶の湯. There is a long tradition of re-appropriating items to be used in the tea ceremony, and a great way to add a European flavour to the tea room.

This 香合 is made by the famous porcelain manufacturer, whose ceramics impressed Queen Victoria at the Great Exhibition in London in 1851, establishing its connection with the European courts.

I've named it 秋の宿 for its beautiful painting. Comes with a paper box.
