A full-blown tea craze took hold, with small tea caddies sometimes worth millions in today's francs! It may sound absurd, but the same mechanisms of social distinction are still at play today, albeit in different forms. This presentation offers an entertaining, sociologically informed look at the tea ceremony as a stage for distinction.
