In a bowl of tea, you taste three things: The tea itself, the water and the host's heart. So in this presentation, not only will I give a brief introduction into the Japanese tea ceremony in general, but also focus on the water. What are the qualities you are looking for in great water for tea?

This presentation takes place at [h≈çmu in Basel](https://homu.ch/). Presentations take place at 13:30 and 15:30, and are held in German. Reservations can be made [here](welcome@homu.ch).
