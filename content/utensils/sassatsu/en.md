This type of 茶箱 is favoured by 利休, and was also famously used by 鵬雲斎 when he made tea in the 和敬 procedure on an airplane carrier during World War 2. It is unadorned, and shows small signs of use. Comes with a paper box.

The 振出 is made by a Kyōto-based [artist](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B9%85%E4%B8%96%E4%B9%85%E5%AE%9D) in the 黄瀬戸-style, and bears the inscription of 颯々 and 今日. Comes in its own paper box.

The set is completed by a 小棗, 茶筅筒 and 香合, all with 蒔絵 of the 四君子, the Four Gentlemen. Those are plum, chrysanthemum, orchid and bamboo; making them suitable for all year around.
