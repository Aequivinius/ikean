I'm originally a bartender who turned to the Japanese tea ritual in search for a **theory of hospitality**. Since the beginning of my training in 2015, I had the opportunity to study under various 裏千家 teachers in Japan and Europe. My practice room I initially put together with things from *IKEA* only, hence I gave it the name 池庵. Here, I try to host 茶事 to deepen my understanding of the way of tea.

While I still haven't completed my theory of hospitality, in tea I found two important pillars: **Humility** and **transience**.

*Humility* as an aesthetic ideal. As a host, I try not to strive to impress the guest. This is difficult, because at the same time you want the guests feel well taken care of. However, everything I do should only serve to make the guest feel comfortable, not to show off whatever refinement I might have. So, I try keep asking myself: *Am I doing this for the guest's sake or my own?* Likewise, the tools we use should show restraint in their elegance, so that they do not distract from the hospitality. If they draw too much attention, the guest's mind cannot come to rest. Instead, if the guest seeks to be entertained, only then should their refinement become apparent.

*Transience* means realising that every instant is unique, and will never happen again in precisely the same way. Rare things are precious, thus such unique instants must be invaluable. Give the guest a chance to focus completely on the here and now, temporarily sheltering them from the ghosts of yesterday and the woes of tomorrow. In matters of taste, the *seasons* and tasteful *signs of wear and use* are principal, as they help the guest to remember such transience.
