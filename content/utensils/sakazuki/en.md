During the meal that precedes the tea ceremony, also rice wine is served. While normally, rice wine is consumed from ceramic cups, during a tea gathering, it is served in a more ceremonial fashion: the very shallow 盃, a plate more than a cup, really, which holds enough liquid for just a few small sips. Serving the 酒 in this way, it feels very precious.

The set comes with a 盃台, a stand for the five individual cups. The entire set I bought in 2018 on [rikyucha](https://www.rikyucha.com/item/list2/283041), and have used it twice since. It is made from lacquered, compressed wood powder. The stand and the cups come with a paper box.
