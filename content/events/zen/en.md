No stereotype about tea is as persistent as the idea that it exists *solely* for meditation. It’s understandable, though — stories often describe how the tea plant sprouted from Buddha’s eyelids or how monks drink tea to stay awake during meditation. Throughout the history of the Japanese tea ceremony, there have been masters who believed that "true tea" could only be understood in the context of Zen Buddhism.<br />While this lecture series highlights many different ways to engage with tea, this particular presentation focuses on its connection to Zen. We’ll discuss concepts like *wabi sabi* and *chanoyu samadhi*, the enlightenment that comes through drinking tea.

This presentation takes place at [hōmu](https://homu.ch/) in Basel. Presentations take place at 13:00 and 15:00.
