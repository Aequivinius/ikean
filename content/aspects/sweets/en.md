As described under [tea](#tea), the sweets and tea form an inseparable unit. Even if you omit the charcoal, the [meal](#kaiseki) and all decorum, you wouldn't fail to serve sweets to your guests. Traditionally, 練切 are served. These sweets are made of a coloured bean paste and shaped into seasonally appropriate shapes. They can be very expressive, but since they are usually made from the same materials, do not convey a *taste* of the season.

However, it is important that the taste of the sweets does not overpower the taste of the tea. In this regard, Japanese tea sweets are particular in their avoidance of fats, which will linger in the mouth and hinder the appreciation of the tea. This needs to be kept in mind when trying out non-Japanese sweets.
