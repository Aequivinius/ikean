While there are many tea caddies in this 中次 shape, the one made from mulberry wood is the one normally used for the 和巾 procedure that was revived by 玄々斎.

There are two items of this type for sale. They vary only marginally: exhibit A is a bit smaller, a bit lighter and can be seen in the 3D model. It comes with a colourful paper box. Exhibit B has a darker colour and marginally higher. It is portrayed on the photos on this page, and comes in a blue cardboard box.
