The name 玉船 is used in Chinese poetry, and describes a vessel for serving rice wine in a courtly setting. One poem in particular comes to mind: *I sit by the red fireplace, and pour from the Jade Boat a golden cup*. It suits this very special tea scoop, with its three nodes and intense shape.

I matched it with a cloth called 阿蘭陀間道, where the first three characters stand for the Netherlands. While the Dutch arrived first in Japan only in 1600, their wares had already made it into Japan before them through the Portuguese, who used the word *Hollanda* to refer to them, and so the Japanese word still is: オランダ or 阿蘭陀.

Includes the 古帛紗 and the tea scoop, both in their own paper box.
