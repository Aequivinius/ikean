<p>This <abbr title="Hagi">萩焼</abbr>-style <abbr title="ido, big well">井戸</abbr>-bowl has little specks of pink, like little specks of sun through the greenery. It gives me a feeling of heralding spring, so I gave it the name <abbr title="ryuu hou">流氷</abbr>. Imagine blocks of ice flowing down a mountain river!</p>
<p>However, with so many seasonal words, it also serves as a reminder to take care of our environment, lest names like this become only a reminder of the past.</p>
<p>Note that this bowl has a small fissure at the rim. Comes in a cardboard box.</p>
