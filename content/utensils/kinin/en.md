Traditionally, a 貴人 is served from a new, white 天目-shaped bowl. This bowl, however, is slightly bent outwards, which gives it a more inviting shape. While it may seem odd to practise a procedure for a nobleman in today's society; I think it is a very smart element of the tea curriculum: First you learn how to treat a nobleman with additional respect than others; then you treat everyone with *that* level of respect. The bowl and stand both come in a paper box.
