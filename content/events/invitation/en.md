The tea ceremony could better be named an *invitation with tea*. In a true ceremony, guests are treated to an artful four-hour experience: food, *sake*, incense, and of course, tea. This presentation explores what makes a good host within the concept of a *tea invitation*, a perspective that's easy to understand in the West, where (formal) invitations hold significant value. Yet, it remains fascinating, as the Japanese tea ceremony arrives at very different answers.

This presentation takes place at [h≈çmu](https://homu.ch/) in Basel. Presentations take place at 13:00 in German and at 15:00 for English.
