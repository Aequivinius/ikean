When the Bodhidharma was invited by Emperor Wu of China, the Emperor was hoping to get some wisdom from the legendary monk. However, then the Emperor asked him who he was, the answer was 不識. It also carries a meaning of *I don't care*, and quite probably was not what the Emperor wanted to hear. However, it shows the rugged, uncompromising attitude of early Buddhism; which this incense container also captures.

*[不識]: fu shiki; I don't know
