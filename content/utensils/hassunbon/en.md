This tray is traditionally used to serve little nibbles to go with *sake*; usually something from the sea and something from the mountains. It is an essential part of the tea ceremony, as this is the one time when the host actually sits down with the guests and shares a cup of *sake* with them. Ulrich Haas explained once that you can leave away most things of the formal tea invitation, except for this sequence called 八寸, the charcoal laying and the actual tea.

The tray itself was used twice, and is slightly damaged at the top left corner for being stored in too dry an environment. Comes with its paper box.

*[八寸]: hassun, meaning 8 inches, referring to the size of the tray
