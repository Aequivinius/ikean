In the tea ceremony, *futaoki* are essential utensils used to rest the kettle lid and the bamboo ladle (*hishaku*). Bamboo *futaoki* are the most orthodox form. Traditionally, fresh green bamboo is used — cut and prepared shortly before the gathering. When fresh bamboo is not available, it is customary to use bamboo *futaoki* that carry an inscription or *kaō* (花押, stylized signature), adding formality and authenticity to the utensil.

This set includes a lid rest for winter (sturdier) and summer (lighter), both contributing to a seasonally appropriate atmosphere.

The box lid inscription reads: **紫野 大徳寺 (Murasakino Daitokuji)**, referring to the priest 山口大痴 (*Yamaguchi Daichi*) from the 興臨院住 (*Korin-in*) sub-temple of the famous Daitokuji in Kyōto. Daitokuji is a head temple of the Rinzai Zen school and deeply connected to tea culture.
