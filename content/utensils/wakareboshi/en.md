This name alludes to 七夕 and the two starts Vega and Altair, representing two lovers that cannot be together. 小林一茶 wrote a poem about the sadness of their separation, saying: *In this world, even the stars are separated*. Naturally, it evokes a mood of autumn loneliness and melancholy. This tea scoop has a few dents near the tip; and also the cloth has a few stains. The scoop comes with a tube and paper box; the cloth with a cardboard box.
