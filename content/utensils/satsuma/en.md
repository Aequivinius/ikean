This 茶碗 is made by an artist who tries to improve the renown of 薩摩焼. Historically, ceramics from 薩摩 were a dignified black; but with time a garish style aimed at exports developed. It is made by a contemporary artist, but in the old style. I find it suitable when a 黒楽 tea bowl is just a little bit too heavy. Comes with the artist's box.

*[茶碗]: chawan, tea bowl

*[薩摩焼]: Satsuma ware
